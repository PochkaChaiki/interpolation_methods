Interpolation methods by AS-21-05

We coded these interpolation methods for our homework. We are the TEAM of young and ambitious programmers who love the work they do. 
Here are the methods:
  1.) Newton's method - coded by Andreev A.
  2.) Lagrange's method - coded by Gadelshin R.
  3.) Less square method - coded by Kobzeva E.
  4.) Linear interpolation - coded by Famutdinov A.

Framework was coded by Kostenko E.
This is our latest masterpiece, so you have to check it. It was done so good because of mutual understanding between each member of our group, WE ARE THE TEAM.
